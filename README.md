# The Gilded Rose Kata
## Summary
This is my attempt to do Emily Bache's
[Gilded Rose](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/python) 
refactoring kata in python.

Read the original 
[kata description](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/README.md) 
and 
[requirements](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.md) 
first.

I do not start with approval tests. I use common unit tests instead.

## Tasks
1. Create a bunch of tests to test the current behaviour of the original code.
2. Refactor the original code to make it maintainable.
3. Add a new feature following the kata's requirement.
